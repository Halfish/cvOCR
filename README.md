# cvOCR
An OCR(Optical Character Recognition) System implemented to recognize the character in a resume or cv.

## Introduction
Before the real OCR process, the preprocess of image, like rotation correction, noise reduction are necessary and vital to improve the accuracy. 
In cvOCR, this preprocess is mainly handled by OpenCV.

## About
This project was developed for ipin.com, because I am working as an algorithm analysis intern here.
